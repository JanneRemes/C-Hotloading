C Hotloading
============

Quick example of compiling a "game's" main loop into a DLL with the ability to reload the DLL at run-time whenever the DLL has changed. A batch file is used to allow compilation while the debugger is attached to the main executable. Idea taken from the Handmade Hero videos + forums.

I've included notes on how to add a hotkey (I used alt + f5) to recompile while running the executable from within Visual Studio, even while the debugger is attached.

Windows only demo.
